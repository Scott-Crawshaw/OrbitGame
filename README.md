# How To Run
Run the `main.py` file. On mac, this can be done by opening Terminal, navigating to this folder, and running `python3 main.py`. On PC, the same steps can be performed in Command Prompt, or a similar command line interface.

# How To Play
Using your cursor, set the direction and the speed of the satellite, as indicted by the length and direction of the dashed line. To launch the satellite, click the left cursor button.

# Video Example
It is very difficult to successfully get the satellite into orbit. Therefore, to spare you the effort, I have included a video of the outcome of a successful launch, where the satellite orbits perpetually. See `orbit.mp4` to watch.
